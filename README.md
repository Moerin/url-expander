URL Expander
============

Short URLs can interfere with the Android experience. A URL that would
normally open directly in YouTube, Twitter, reddit, or any other
dedicated app now requires a round trip to the browser. URL Expander
aims to fix this.

URL Expander has the following goals:

* Seamless experience
* Persistent caching
* Graceful degradation

It handles a hardcoded list of known URL shorteners.
